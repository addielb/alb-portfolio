## Features
This site contains several pages of information about the corresponding page titles.
* **Software Engineering**: This portion lists the various technologies, frameworks, and languages I am experienced in. It also includes links to the GitHub repositories of projects I have worked on, along with descriptions of my roles in those projects.
* **Work History**: This portion breaks down various jobs I've had that aren't necessarily on my resume, along with pictures of projects and my favorite patients from my time as a veterinary assistant! My diverse working background is one of my biggest strengths--I chase what I'm interested in and I have learned many skills that translate across any position.
* **Art**: This portion has some photos of completed art pieces of mine. Art is my favorite hobby, one I have been doing to varying levels of seriousness since childhood. Over the past several years, I have rekindled my excitement in doodling, making large-scale doodle projects exploring nature.

* Tailwind
