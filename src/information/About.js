  softwareEngineer: [
    "I have always been naturally good with computers, but only in the last two years did I start really diving in. Motivated by the dopamine rush of solving problems, I've found deep satisfaction in building websites, databases, and everything in between.",
    "My usual stack is JavaScript/Node.js, React, Express, and either MongoDB or MySQL. I also have experience in HTML/CSS, Python, and many different DBMS. I have experience across the full spectrum of software engineering: web development to system design--and I still can't choose a favorite!",
    'As a relatively new engineer, I\'m looking to be a part of a team with strong mentorship opportunities where I can keep developing my skills to one day be a senior engineer. I\'m open to taking on projects on my own, but I\'m still keeping those fairly small-scale while I focus on getting a foot in the door of the industry. I have contributed to some open source projects, and I\'m continuing to look for similar opportunities. To see more about my achievements in software, check out the Software Projects portion of this site!'
