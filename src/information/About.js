    "I have always been naturally good with computers, but only in the last two years did I start really diving in. Motivated by the dopamine rush of solving problems, I've found deep satisfaction in building websites, databases, and everything in between. My usual stack is JavaScript/Node.js, React, Express, and either MongoDB or MySQL. I also have experience in HTML/CSS, Python, and many different DBMS. I have experience across the full spectrum of software engineering: web development to system design--and I still can't choose a favorite! I have served as the de facto tech support at every job I've had--no matter how technical the actual position. I discovered my love for technology and engineering when I was an intern with Starstruck entertainment. I would spend my shifts shadowing the tech lead while we modified, fixed, and built audio technology.",
    'As a relatively new engineer, I\'m looking to be a part of a team with strong mentorship opportunities where I can keep developing my skills to one day be a senior engineer. I\'m open to taking on projects on my own, but I\'m still keeping those fairly small-scale while I focus on getting a foot in the door of the industry. I have contributed to some open source projects, and I\'m continuing to look for similar opportunities. To see more about my achievements in software, check out the Software Projects portion of this site!',
    'When I\'m not at the computer, I love to be outside, draw, and play video games. My favorite series is The Legend of Zelda--I\'ve been playing Zelda games since I was six and Wind Waker had just come out. When drawing, I prefer markers and oil pastels, and I typically focus on nature for subject matter. I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, moved to Nashville for college and stayed for seven years, and just last summer moved out to Denver. I\'m thankful for all the lessons I\'ve learned around the country and all the diverse people I\'ve met through it. There\'s a little piece of me that lives in all of my homes still. I also love to travel, and recently fell in love with Amsterdam, though any walkable, artistic city will steal my heart. I\'m also the lucky mom to three beautiful cats, Claire (13), Debora (3), and Missy (2) (full name Artemis... but she\'s not smart enough to be called Artemis). Since my partner and I don\'t have our own children, the girls are very spoiled but they are also all very sweet. They will make an appearance on any Zoom meeting!'
