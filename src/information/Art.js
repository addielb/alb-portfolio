    dates: 'September 2023',
    description: 'Inspired by \'Self Portrait As A Moirologist\' by Kathryn Bratt-Pfotenhauer, this piece explores my complicated relationship with death, grief, and night. I\ve also long loved crows and dream of building a real friendship with my local murder. Read the poem!',

    dates: 'January 2023',
    description: 'I saw a picture from inside an Ironwood tree on Reddit and wanted to explore the light and shadows inside a tree. A comrade was murdered by police the week I finished this piece, so it became a dedication to them and their devotion to the Welaunee Forest. More trees; fewer cops.',

    description: 'An entry to Jerry\'s Artarama Nashville Halloween contest, this is a still life of my altar as it was set up for Samhain. Samhain is the Celtic/Irish "Halloween" where the death and ancestors are honored and celebrated. The mirror portal in the middle is, of course, added for style--I\'ve yet to enter any other dimensions.',

    dates: 'December 2022',
    description: 'Growing up, my favorite movie was (and honestly still is) \'My Neighbor Totoro\' from Studio Ghibli. To celebrate the art that inspired so much of my style, I redesigned the totoros in the style of mine and my sister\'s cats, and drew the two sisters as a younger version of my sister and me. I see so much of my childhood in this movie, and I love that I was able to recreate such a sweet feeling in my own life.',

    title: 'Flowers',
    dates: 'June 2022 - February 2023',
    description: 'My favorite style that I do--this piece is 18" x 24", filled with months of doodles. I have tried over the years to keep diaries but they never last. I used to love doodling during class; I found it much easier to concentrate. So when I graduated college I found a missing part of my life, but doodling didn\'t feel enough like "art" until I started making larger scale pieces. And now these are my most popular pieces, so screw you 7th grade Algebra teacher.'

    description: 'My first exploration into character design: my D&D character, Licha Moss. Licha is a proud representative of the MLM "FungaLife" which specializes in healthy shakes for druid elves. Licha came from modest beginnings as a chaotic good backwoods elf who--after a surprising encounter with a certain deck of cards--transformed into her lawful evil salesperson self we know and love today. She\'s a real #MossBabe.',

    description: 'One of my first explorations into the doodle style. This piece started as more of a proof of concept, and as it evolved I started to see the flaws in the composition and what I would want to do next. While I\'ve always prefered warm colors to cool, I chose this color scheme in honor of my partner, who the piece is for. Of course, I didn\'t finish it until we lived together, but he knows it\'s his at least.',

    description: 'A continuation of my doodle projects, this is a focus on warm colors and differentiation as they overlap. This is also the first piece I switched to black outlines for. If it wasn\'t already obvious, mushrooms--any nature really, but specifically mushrooms--are a favorite subject of mine, and I wanted to revist the doodle mushroom concept and improve upon it using my own favorite colors.',

My partner\'s D&D character, Thecius, is a nerdy wizard who prefers to summon elementals for his dirty work. Small brag--my partner is very witty and frequently comes up with silly names for said elementals, this one being "Liberal Tears Gas Stove" as it was a fire elemental.',

    description: 'I used to hate winter--the cold and dark has always unsettled me. Until Winter 2021, where I had a chill, work-from-home job (not a high bar compared to the hospitality industry I was used to) and got to indulge my human urges to be slower, quieter, calmer, and less active during the winter. I started to appreciate the early nights because it brought stars, the open window into the chill because I could be warm and still, and the quiet while the local wildlife hibernates.',
